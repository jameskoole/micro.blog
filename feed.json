Perhaps you plan to camp in various State Parks in NY and PA, visiting gorges and glens and other natural wonders.\n\nThe theme of that road trip is one of seeing nature‚Äôs wonders, specifically those around rivers. You might have a side theme of ‚Äúsmall town America‚Äù and perhaps even something like a plan to hit tourist traps like scenic caves or other tacky ‚Äúwonders‚Äù as you see them.\n\nWith a road map, you tend to stick to highways an have a path from A to B. With a road trip, the plan is less defined, but over the course of the next few months or a year, you know generally where you‚Äôd like to go and what you‚Äôd like to see.\n\nAs a PM, that means we might have themes like ‚Äúbetter serve our large customers‚Äù or ‚Äúadd tools to make managing DNS easier‚Äù or ‚Äúreduce support costs with better inline help‚Äù.\n\nThroughout the year you can be opportunistic and tackle some things that relate to each theme as they come up. Just like in a road trip, you might be ‚Äúfreestyling‚Äù a bit here and there. Perhaps you get the resources to do a specific task for a week or three and you can jump on it and get it (or part of it) done.\n\nMaybe a series of small bits of work can be bundled over time to equal one big piece.\n\nThe key is to have a big picture in mind, to be flexible and agile, and to always know how each bit of work that you get done can fit into the bigger set of goals to keep things moving forward.\n",
