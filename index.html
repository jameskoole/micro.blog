			 <p>The last of our mask mandates in Ontario will be gone on Saturday including transit. Probably for the best as especially on GO, more people have been acting like the mandate was already lifted. With no enforcement, there no point anymore. Federal mandates remain so I think travellers on planes and VIA Rail trains will still require masks.</p>

			 <p>The macOS Ventura beta is quite solid as well (like the iOS beta). I&rsquo;m surprised at how many of the features work. Continuity Camera is pretty cool. Looks like the family photos sharing isn&rsquo;t there yet. System Preferences&hellip;errr&hellip;Settings is going to take some getting used to (it&rsquo;s not great). I&rsquo;m not sure about Stage Manager yet. I think it&rsquo;s really an iPadOS feature that is on the Mac as well.</p>

			 <p>#WWDC hot takes: iPadOS updates might be the game changers pro iPad users have always dreamed of. iOS updates are nice, especially the lock screen updates. I thing Stage Manager might be a great update to the Mission Control UX I love. Something tells me there won&rsquo;t be another Mac Pro ever. M2 is evolutionary, not revolutionary. The new MacBook Air is curious, as is keeping the old one around at $999. The 13&quot; MacBook Pro with TouchBar and M2 is a giant WTF.</p>

			 <p>I have a few places I post things online. I don&rsquo;t tend to use <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> as I think of my various online services as being <em>channels</em> for content that is organized by theme or audience. This is an attempt to document those channels.</p>
<p>I have two Twitter accounts. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jameskoole">@jameskoole</a> is my original account that goes back to 2007. It&rsquo;s effectively &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; at this point and I only use it to follow a few friends. I don&rsquo;t tweet on that account. The other is <a href="https://www.twitter.com/tracksideto">@TracksideTO</a> which started out as my railfanning account but has become more of a general transport nerd place for me. I follow a bunch of people here and post occasionally about transit, trains, planes and anything else related to my interests in transportation.</p>
<p>I have two Instagram accounts as well. The first is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jameskooleto">@jameskooleTO</a> which is my personal Instagram account. I don&rsquo;t post much here unless I&rsquo;m on vacation or doing something worth sharing. The other is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tracksidetoronto">@TracksideToronto</a> which is where I post photos of trains and other things that are on rails. This used to be my personal Instagram but a year after I started posting mostly train-related photos, I renamed it to better reflect the content and to hang on to my followers.</p>
<p>Then there is my <a href="https://www.jameskoole.com">personal website</a> and which is also my Micro.blog. I use this to post both short and longer posts. It&rsquo;s what I would have put on Twitter in the past. Generally this is related to technology or more personal content.</p>
<p>I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TracksideToronto">YouTube channel for Trackside Toronto</a> which is where I post videos of trains and other rail content. Lastly, I have a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/tracksidetoronto/">Flickr account</a> that also features rail photography and serves as a place to put more photos and higher quality images than Instagram hosts.</p>

<li>Perhaps near a body of water (either a river, or lake, or the sea).</li>
<li>Connected to the internet at high speed (Starlink <em>might</em> be the way, but i wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to count on that forever).</li>

<p>Then I&rsquo;ll do a 12km run that includes two level crossings of the CP North Toronto sub, and a pedestrian tunnel under the GO Newmarket sub and a short bit on the West Toronto Railpath to Bloor Station.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll catch the UP Express there to get back to Union Station where I&rsquo;ll see VIA Rail #1 &ldquo;The Canadian&rdquo; departing for Vancouver at 9:45 A.M.. Finally, it&rsquo;ll be back on the GO again to get back to Danforth and another short run home.</p>
<p>Bonus: I&rsquo;ll be back on the GO at Danforth with Mac just after noon to head out to Aldershot to meet up with the other half of the fam for a Sunday afternoon extended family get together. Sadly we&rsquo;ll have to drive back to Toronto after that which will likely feature terrible traffic.</p>

			 <p>Contrast with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) here in my city which, for whatever reason, seems intent on linking accessibility with handicap or disability. That goes all the way down to using the wheelchair icon on the link to their <a href="https://www.ttc.ca/accessibility">Accessibility page</a>. Removing barriers to transit usage is more than accommodating disabled riders. Step-free describes the removal of physical barriers beautifully and I wish the TTC used that term here.</p>
<p>Accessibility should be inclusive of all barriers, both physical and non-physical. That could include things like financial barriers, language, wayfinding, safety and even where transit is provided in the city to ensure that all residents have equitable access to move around their city.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I can make certain pages or databases available publically so things like my running race log can be managed in Notion, but available as a page linked from <a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/runnerjames/">my micro.blog</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently using a four-hour flight back to Toronto to get my <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> setup sorted out, and to do a bunch of thinking and writing about how I want to structure things going forward and to generally simplify and streamline my online world.</p>
<p>In short, it&rsquo;ll be less Twitter, more micro.blog. Less running blog, more micro.blog. It&rsquo;ll also be more private journalling (in Notion) and more note-taking and capturing of thoughts, ideas and plans privately, but online.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve disconnected my Twitter from micro.blog and taken it private (and kicked a bunch of followers I didn&rsquo;t either know or interact with). I&rsquo;ll continue to use it as an information source but not as a place to post or share. Quite honestly, I don&rsquo;t see a long-term future for the service if the plan is to start charging companies and journalists/news outlets to use it.</p>
<p>Mastodon was a short-lived experiment that ended after about a week. The experience there is just a mess. Federation is not the solution. As I did in the past, I found Mastodon to be a whole bunch of people that I didn&rsquo;t really want to interact with and who have different ideas and perspectives from mine. To each their own&hellip;no judgement&hellip;it&rsquo;s just not a place for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also decided to fold my running blog for a few reasons. Mostly I&rsquo;m done training for a race for a bit and I don&rsquo;t have much to share. Those who want to follow me as a runner can do so via <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/135739">Strava</a> instead. I&rsquo;ll archive off those posts and put the content into Notion for posterity-sake.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jameskooleto">Instagram</a> will remain as I enjoy posting the odd photo there and also seeing the photos of my friends as they post theirs. I don&rsquo;t follow brands or anything like that since in my mind Instagram is for personal photos not for advertising.</p>
<p>That leaves this micro.blog which is really just a stand-in for a more formal personal blog. It&rsquo;s a stress-free place to post short things or long things and to have a bit of a website too. If nobody reads it, that&rsquo;s fine. If they do, that&rsquo;s also fine.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Community is what people look for online, and in real life. The big problem with Twitter is that there&rsquo;s not an effective way for communities to section off and interact. It&rsquo;s a loud stadium full of people of all interests, all trying (and failing) to effectively communicate. Broadcasters (literal and figurative) do well on Twitter because they are only interested in one-way communication. Think news networks or celebrities looking to easily push out information to the masses. Once the information is pushed, the broadcaster doesn&rsquo;t care about the discussion. Show me a news Twitter account that interacts. They don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Mastodon attempts to solve for this shortcoming in Twitter by putting users into smaller interest-based communities, while maintaining the ability to participate outside of your chosen community through federation. That federation can feel like cross-talk sometimes, while at other times it can be more like an invasion depending on the sizes of the communities involved.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this? I&rsquo;m not sure. Discord might be one, but it favours community discussion over broadcast and I think a lot of people are actually seeking out that broadcast type system (either as a broadcaster, or reciever).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve switched over to <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> (using my own domain) as a way to take back some control. It&rsquo;s $5/month, including custom domain mapping. The content is stored in an easy-to-export format. The templates are simple and easy.</p>

			 <p>A few months back, before the COVID-19 pandemic basically destroyed air traffic, I set up a Raspberry Pi as an ADS-B feeder for aircraft data in my area.</p>
<p>ADS-B stands for Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast and it’s a technology that allows aircraft to transmit their positional data over open airwaves in order to be tracked by anyone who wishes to receive and decode it.</p>
<p>It’s meant to function as part of the Next-Generation Air Transportation System and forms the backbone of a new air traffic navigation system for the next century.</p>
<p>How it works isn’t really important, but the fact that anyone can set up a receiver, add some software to decode the data and display it on a map, is amazing. From there, you can feed the data to popular aggregators that allow anyone, anywhere in the world to see almost all the aircraft in the sky anywhere in the world in real time.</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My Setup</h2>
<p>Receiving and feeding ADS-B requires both hardware and software. Everything is pretty easy to acquire and install, as long as you have some computer skills and the ability to follow instructions.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>I opted to purchase a few things from Amazon to get started. My total investment was about $150 for the hardware. The software is all open source and provided for free. Supplying data to various sites gets me premium accounts that offer some big benefits to aviation enthusiasts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4. this credit-card sized computer runs Linux and can be had for as little as about $40. I opted for a model with 4GB of RAM along with a case and power supply.</li>
<li>FlightAware Pro Stick Plus SDR. A USB software defined radio receiver, specifically tuned to the ADS-B band with some special filters to improve reception of the signals from aircraft.</li>
<li>FlightAware 1090MHz ADS-B Antenna. A tuned outdoor antenna that really improves range. In my case, I also added a 25ft. cable to run from the Raspberry Pi, through the wall and to my antenna which is mounted on our second-floor deck.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>On the software side, I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FlightAware package for Raspberry Pi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get started with feeding. Once that was up and running, I layered the FlightRadar24 software on top and began feeding data to both services.</p>
<p>The FlightAware software has a built-in web server that creates a local tracking site that shows all the aircraft being tracked by my system on a map with tracks and other details. They also have a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stats page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the web that is publicly accessible where you can see lots of details about my feeder including flights tracked over the last 30 days, range information and more.</p>
<p>Both FlightAware and Flightradar24 offer upgraded accounts for anyone who feeds data. On the Flightradar24 side, they give you a free Business account which is the highest level they have. It’s totally overkill for a hobbiest, but being able to view two years of history or make your own custom fleets is a nice bonus. As long as you keep feeding data, you can enjoy the upgraded account.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-the-global-pandemic">The Impact of the Global Pandemic</h2>
<p>Covid-19 is having a severe impact on the number of flights in the sky over our area. When I first activated my receiver I would see hundreds of flights an hour. Over the course of March and April, that dwindled down to just a handful with private planes and cargo flights making up a lot of the traffic I was tracking.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, the number of flights I’m tracking has been slowly rising. Some days I see as many as 500 aircraft now and at peak times the number of flights tracked in an hour is more than 50. That’s still about 20% of what it was pre-Covid, but it is interesting to watch as air traffic slowly returns.</p>

			 <p>My job went full remote on March 9, 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread around the globe. I had hit the office over the weekend when the email went around to all staff and I grabbed a couple of monitors and my keyboard, mouse and laptop stand to help get a good setup in my basement office.</p>
<p>We had travel planned for the week following that, so after four days working from home, we drove south for nine days. On our return, the real work from home experience began. A part of my team has always worked remotely for some of the week, so the transition to 100% remote went really smoothly. We already used Slack extensively and our Google accounts were upgraded to Enterprise giving us the ability to host Meet calls with hundreds of people.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks in we on-boarded a new developer who I had only met once during the interview process. She was the last non-employee in our building the Friday prior to our offices closing down. That all went great with the company shipping out a configured laptop to her. She was coming from a full-remote position at another company so for her, the transition was smooth.</p>
<p>A couple of months into our new work from anywhere lifestyle, here’s a few pros and cons that I’ve put together based on my experience.</p>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sleeping in. I used to be up at 6:00 A.M. and out the door at about 7:10 A.M. to catch my train into the office. Now, I wake up without an alarm and roll out of bed around 7:30 A.M. while still starting work at 8:00 A.M. as before.</li>
<li>Lunch runs. To be able to get in 8-10km of running on my lunch hour is a real treat. After work time: I finish up most days by about 4:30 P.M. which means ample time to get out to run an errand or go grocery shopping before dinner.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>A non-empty house. my wife works from home upstairs and our two high-schoolers are doing school from home as well. That’s a lot of people around the house all the time and it’s sometimes distracting.</li>
<li>No social time. I miss the idle chit-chat, coffee runs, impromptu conversations and the other social aspects of office life. We’ve replaced some of that with more Meets and Slack calls, but it’s not the same.</li>
<li>Cold feet. being in the basement all day, especially in March and early April was sometimes tough. It’s not exactly warm down here and so a space heater and a blanket was sometimes required to stay comfortable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, it’s been more positive than negative. I do enjoy the time away from work on the weekends and I’ve set some boundaries to resist the urge to sit down and work on Saturday or in the evenings. Shutting down Slack and email and turning off notifications during off hours really helps with that. Keeping the daily routine of a specific start time and end time also helps in ensuring that work and non-work time is clearly defined.</p>
<p>I suspect we’ll be working from home for quite some time still and there’s always the possibility that I never go back to the office. I’ve long dreamed of moving out west to Vancouver, and so maybe this new remote work reality will finally make that at least somewhat possible.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A recent episode of Under the Radar (#182) with Marco Arment and David Smith got me thinking some more about planning for the 2020 year as a Product Manager and how to approach that when you have different challenges.</p>
<p>We’re really short on resources at the moment for various reasons, and that has a significant impact on my ability to plan out the year. We also depend a lot on teams across other areas in the bigger company which means I have little or no control over when (and even if) related blocker work gets done that allows us to do our work.</p>
<p>Sounds awesome, right? It’s not.</p>
<p>A lot of PMs and companies have a roadmap for the next few months and probably as long as a year or more. I can’t think that way as there’s no real solid way that we can get on a journey and get there thanks to the various challenges outlined above.</p>
<p>So instead of a roadmap, I’ve come to think in terms of a road trip. The difference is that a road trip is more of a general idea of where we’d like to head, than a real defined plan of where we are going.</p>
<p>When you embark on a road trip, you might have a theme or themes that guide you to what the whole point of it might be. Perhaps you plan to camp in various State Parks in NY and PA, visiting gorges and glens and other natural wonders.</p>
<p>The theme of that road trip is one of seeing nature’s wonders, specifically those around rivers. You might have a side theme of “small town America” and perhaps even something like a plan to hit tourist traps like scenic caves or other tacky “wonders” as you see them.</p>
<p>With a road map, you tend to stick to highways an have a path from A to B. With a road trip, the plan is less defined, but over the course of the next few months or a year, you know generally where you’d like to go and what you’d like to see.</p>
<p>As a PM, that means we might have themes like “better serve our large customers” or “add tools to make managing DNS easier” or “reduce support costs with better inline help”.</p>
<p>Throughout the year you can be opportunistic and tackle some things that relate to each theme as they come up. Just like in a road trip, you might be “freestyling” a bit here and there. Perhaps you get the resources to do a specific task for a week or three and you can jump on it and get it (or part of it) done.</p>
<p>Maybe a series of small bits of work can be bundled over time to equal one big piece.</p>
<p>The key is to have a big picture in mind, to be flexible and agile, and to always know how each bit of work that you get done can fit into the bigger set of goals to keep things moving forward.</p>
